# ZEngine Examples

Examples on how to use [ZEngine](https://github.com/bluesillybeard/ZEngine) and its official modules.

## Dependencies
- Zig version 0.12.0-dev.3146+671c2acf4 or compatible
- SDL2
- OpenGL 4.6
    - Why 4.6 when only rendering basic stuff? Because I use static layout locations and bindings, which was apparently not added until OpenGL 4.
